# adk-go-typesafe

[TypeSafe AI](https://typesafe.ai/) System One integration for [adk-go](https://github.com/google/adk-go), bringing Choice, Score, Noul, and Box primitives to Go agents and workflows with models such as [Jev](https://typesafe.ai/blog/introducing-system-one-models-and-jev).

Provides a typed HTTP client, ADK function tool, classification and routing agent, assessment callbacks, and dynamic context filtering. The client is a temporary bridge until TypeSafe publishes a Go SDK; its API types are generated from TypeSafe's OpenAPI schema.

**Other providers:** [adk-go-bedrock](https://github.com/craigh33/adk-go-bedrock) · [adk-go-ollama](https://github.com/craigh33/adk-go-ollama) · [adk-go-kronk](https://github.com/craigh33/adk-go-kronk)

## Requirements

- **Go**: match [`go.mod`](go.mod).
- Live examples will require a **TypeSafe API key** (`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`); see the [TypeSafe quick start](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction/quickstart).

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/craigh33/adk-go-typesafe
```

## Usage

```go
import "github.com/craigh33/adk-go-typesafe/typesafe"

client, err := typesafe.New(nil) // Reads TYPESAFE_API_KEY.
if err != nil {
    return err
}

response, err := client.Evaluate(ctx, &typesafe.Request{
    State: "I was charged twice. Please refund the duplicate payment.",
    Questions: map[string]typesafe.Question{
        "department": typesafe.Choice{
            Instructions: "Which team should handle this?",
            Criteria: map[string]any{
                "billing":   "Payments and refunds",
                "technical": "Bugs and integrations",
            },
        },
        "urgent": typesafe.Noul{Instructions: "Does this require immediate attention?"},
    },
})
if err != nil {
    return err
}

department := response.Answers["department"].(typesafe.ChoiceAnswer)
fmt.Println(department.Choice, department.Confidence, department.Probabilities)
```

`Choice` selects a named option, `Score` evaluates ordered levels, `Noul` returns the probability of yes, and `Box` locates a target in an image. Responses retain probabilities, confidence, score legends, box coordinates, model identity, and token usage. State accepts text, JSON objects, or arrays; question instructions and criteria can also contain structured JSON.

The default model is `jev-latest`. Set `Options.Model` for a client default or `Request.Model` for a single evaluation. `Options` also accepts an API key, base URL, HTTP client, and `Headers` (`http.Header`) to add or override request headers. The client copies configured headers and preserves them across retries. The default timeout is ten seconds; context cancellation is preserved. Use `errors.As` with `*typesafe.APIError` to inspect `StatusCode` and `RetryAfter`.

### Images

Enable experimental image support through `Options.Headers`, attach PNG or JPEG bytes through `Request.Assets`, and place each asset's reference in state, instructions, or criteria:

```go
client, err := typesafe.New(&typesafe.Options{
    Headers: http.Header{"Typesafe-Danger-Zone-Images": {"true"}},
})
if err != nil {
    return err
}

data, err := os.ReadFile("examples/images/person-indoors.jpg")
if err != nil {
    return err
}

reference := rand.Text() // crypto/rand; use a unique reference to avoid text collisions.

response, err := client.Evaluate(ctx, &typesafe.Request{
    State: map[string]any{"photo": reference},
    Assets: map[string]typesafe.Image{reference: {Data: data}},
    Questions: map[string]typesafe.Question{
        "person_present": typesafe.Noul{Instructions: "Is there a person in `photo`?"},
    },
})
```

The client detects the format and base64-encodes the bytes in JSON. Files must be at most 16 MiB, each side 256–1568 pixels, and at least 78,400 pixels in total. Encoded image requests, including base64 and text, are capped at 32 MiB. Prepare upright, still images before sending; the client does not resize or rotate them. Every asset must be referenced, including when nested or embedded in a longer string. See [TypeSafe's image documentation](https://docs.typesafe.ai/images) and the [image example](examples/typesafe-images).

### Box questions

Add a `typesafe.Box` question to an image request and select `Model: "jev-1.14.0"` or `"jev-preview"`:

```go
Questions: map[string]typesafe.Question{
    "bench_present": typesafe.Noul{Instructions: "Is there a park bench in `photo`?"},
    "bench": typesafe.Box{Instructions: "the park bench in `photo`"},
},
```

Read the result as `response.Answers["bench"].(typesafe.BoxAnswer)`. `Box.Top`, `Box.Bottom`, `Box.Left`, and `Box.Right` are normalized edges between zero and one. `Confidence` is a `*float64`; nil preserves the API's `null` when confidence is unavailable. A Box always returns coordinates, even for an absent target, so use the accompanying Noul answer to decide whether to use it.

Box questions use the same images header configured above and work with the ADK tool and classification agent's existing image inputs. See the [runnable Box example](examples/typesafe-box) and [TypeSafe's Box documentation](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/box).

### Opt-in retries

```go
client, err := typesafe.New(&typesafe.Options{Retry: &typesafe.RetryPolicy{}})
```

Retries are disabled by default. A zero `RetryPolicy` enables three total attempts for HTTP 429 and 529, with exponential backoff and jitter from 250 milliseconds up to five seconds. Set `MaxAttempts`, `InitialBackoff`, and `MaxBackoff` to override these defaults. A valid `Retry-After` is a minimum delay; if it exceeds the maximum backoff, the original error is returned without another attempt. Transport errors and other statuses are not retried. Use a context deadline to bound the entire evaluation.

## ADK tool

```go
import "github.com/craigh33/adk-go-typesafe/tools/systemone"

evaluate, err := systemone.New(systemone.Config{
    API: client,
    Questions: map[string]typesafe.Question{
        "urgent": typesafe.Noul{Instructions: "Does this require immediate attention?"},
    },
})
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// Add evaluate to llmagent.Config.Tools.
```

The application fixes the questions and rubrics; the calling agent supplies text in `state` and optional image artifact names in `artifacts`. Configure the runner's `ArtifactService` to load images through `ctx.Artifacts().Load`. The tool evaluates them as `{"text": state, "images": {filename: image}}` and retains text-only state as a string. ADK generates the tool's input schema from its Go input type. The tool returns the full structured evaluation and works with ADK models that support function tools, including your Bedrock, Ollama, or Kronk setup. For application-defined structured state, use the client directly.

All adapters depend on `typesafe.Evaluator`, so the HTTP implementation can later be replaced by an adapter for the official SDK. The tool's existing `EvaluationAPI` name remains an alias. No ADK core changes or `model.LLM` implementation are required.

## Classification and routing agent

```go
import systemoneagent "github.com/craigh33/adk-go-typesafe/agent/systemone"

triage, err := systemoneagent.New(systemoneagent.Config{
    Name: "triage",
    API: client,
    Questions: map[string]typesafe.Question{
        "department": typesafe.Choice{Criteria: map[string]any{
            "billing": "Payments and refunds", "technical": "Bugs and integrations",
        }},
    },
    Routing: &systemoneagent.Routing{
        Question: "department",
        MinConfidence: 0.75,
        Routes: map[string]agent.Agent{"billing": billingAgent, "technical": technicalAgent},
        Fallback: clarificationAgent,
    },
})
```

Supply existing ADK children in `Routes` and `Fallback`, then use `triage` with an ADK runner. Confidence at or above the threshold selects the matching child; low confidence or an unmapped choice selects the fallback. API failures stop execution. The full assessment, usage, and routing decision are saved in session state under `OutputKey` (default: the agent's name) before the child runs. The iterator emits the classifier assessment followed by the child's events; consume the full iterator to run the child.

Omit `Routing` for a standalone classification agent. By default it evaluates the initiating user's text and inline PNG/JPEG parts, including those created with `genai.NewPartFromBytes`. Images are converted to TypeSafe assets automatically. Provide `State func(agent.InvocationContext) (any, error)` to override that projection with structured input or session context. Treat question definitions as immutable after construction. See the [Bedrock routing example](examples/bedrock-routing) and [ADK image example](examples/systemone-images) for complete wiring.

## Assessment callbacks

`callbacks/systemone` provides `BeforeModel`, `AfterModel`, and `BeforeTool`. Each takes a `Config` containing the evaluator, fixed questions, and a required application `Policy` that returns `Decision{Block, Reason}`. Attach the resulting callback to the corresponding `llmagent.Config` callback list.

- `BeforeModel` assesses request messages; blocking replaces the response before the model runs.
- `AfterModel` assesses the model response; blocking replaces the output. Use non-streaming execution: partial responses are rejected.
- `BeforeTool` assesses the tool name and arguments; blocking returns a structured explanation without executing the tool.

Set `OutputKey` to persist the latest assessment and decision. API, policy, and state-storage errors propagate. Assessments inform application policy; they do not replace authorization checks. See the [callback example](examples/systemone-assessment) for all three hooks with an explicit Noul threshold.

## Dynamic context filter

`plugins/contextfilter` is a native ADK runner plugin that selects relevant historical turns before each model call using Jev Noul judgments:

```go
filter, err := contextfilter.New(contextfilter.Config{
    API: client,
    Observe: true, // Inspect proposals before enabling removal.
    OnReport: func(_ agent.Context, report contextfilter.Report) {
        // Inspect report.Decisions, report.RemovedTurns, report.Usage and report.Err.
    },
})
// Handle err, then use this in runner.Config.PluginConfig.
plugins := runner.PluginConfig{Plugins: []*plugin.Plugin{filter}}
```

Set `Observe: false` to apply removals. `Config.Model` defaults to `jev-latest` independently of the client's default; set it explicitly to use another model. Defaults protect two recent turns, skip histories below 8 KiB of projected text, and remove older turns only when relevance is below 0.1. `Pin` protects an application-selected message's entire turn. System instructions, compaction summaries, unsupported content, and incomplete or cross-turn tool pairs are retained. A non-text or unrecognizable current input skips review.

Filtering selects original messages for the outgoing request without modifying saved history. Older turns can return when ADK supplies them again; filtering cannot restore originals already replaced by ADK compaction. ADK runs plugins before agent callbacks. Assessments that need the complete request must run in an earlier runner plugin.

Historical turns are reviewed in sequential batches capped at 64 KiB of JSON (`MaxRequestBytes`), including questions and repeated protected context. All batches share a two-second timeout. These are configurable byte/time budgets, not token limits. Oversized turns stay intact; oversized protected context skips review. An evaluation failure stops further batches, retaining failed and unreviewed turns while allowing earlier valid decisions to apply. Parent cancellation prevents removals and propagates. `OnReport` runs once with proposed ranges, actual removals, review errors and aggregate known Jev usage. Measure downstream usage and latency separately. See the [context-filter example](examples/context-filter) for complete wiring.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development tools and contribution guidelines.

`make generate` uses a pinned generator and loads [TypeSafe's OpenAPI definition](https://api.typesafe.ai/openapi.json) directly. CI checks that the committed generated types match the live definition. Normal builds use those committed types; generation tools and schema downloads are not required by library consumers. See [api](api) for details.
